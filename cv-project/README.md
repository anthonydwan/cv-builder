# Getting Started with React - CV Buillder Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Challenges

- This is the first full project inplementing React. One of the major difficulties (other than familiarising with the syntax) was my implementation of object rendering that invovled adding new key-value pairs that is deep inside a state object.

- Since the application involved extensive use of form html elements, I got to practise many intricacies of conditional rendering which involved different input elements. Pushing all of the states to the parent component for better maintenance of states and avoid conflicts (all of the states are on the top level which is then passed to children elements through props in a deeply nested tree)
